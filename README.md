# HOG Feature Descriptor with Python and OpenCV

With this code, I practiced the HOG algorithm/feature descriptor, which is widely used in object identification, extracted the HOG feature vector from an image using the Python programming language and the OpenCV library. I tried to visualize and present the HOG algorithm/feature descriptor by analyzing the HOG image and histograms looking at a closer scale.
